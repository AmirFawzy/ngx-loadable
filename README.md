## Problem

Angular provides an easy way for adding route based lazy loading modules. But in most of the projects, each route tends to have a lot of different components. It could be because of lots of modals, tabs, and components that appear based on user interaction in a single route.

## Solution

The `ngx-loadable` wraps the complex implementation for lazy loading non routable modules in a simple API. It provides a Directive and a Component to lazy load modules. A directive can be used for simple lazy loading modules, but if you want more control over the loading of lazy loading modules, by prefetching, then prefer using component.

## Install

Install and manage the ngx-loadable using NPM. You may use `yarn` or `npm`.

`npm install ngx-loadable --save`

or

`yarn add ngx-loadable`

## Usage

### NgModule
Import the LoadableModule in the NgModule and declare them in the "imports", you can also use the `forRoot()` for `forChild()` function.

``` ts
import { LoadableModule } from 'ngx-loadable';

@NgModule({
  imports: [
    LoadableModule
  ]
})
```
